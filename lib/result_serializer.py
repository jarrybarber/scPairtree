    # Currently, this is backed by an LZMA-compressed zip archive, where each
    # file within is either JSON-encoded or NumPy-encoded.
    # However, switching the implementation so it's backed by HDF5 instead should
    # be easy if I decide to do so -- the API as I've designed it here should
    # allow this.
    #
    # Initially, I used a tar rather than zip archive. However, tar is in an
    # inferior format insofar as it does not allow seeking to specific files
    # being read -- it alternates file headers with file names, so (potentially)
    # the entire file must be decompressed to locate a specific file the user
    # wants. Zip does not suffer this limitation.
    #
    # Pickle is a strictly unacceptable choice since it allows arbitrary code
    # execution. If I used Pickle (as I initially did), users could not safely
    # exchange results with one another.
    #
    # It's probably possible to append new files on `save()` to the zip file
    # rather than rewriting the whole file. If/when file IO becomes a bottleneck,
    # I should look into this.
